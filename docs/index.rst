Welcome to Flask-Ask
====================

Building high-quality Alexa skills for Amazon Echo Devices takes time. Flask-Ask makes it easier and much more fun.
Use Flask-Ask with `ngrok <https://ngrok.com/>`_ to eliminate the deploy-to-test step and get work done faster.

Flask-Ask:

* Verifies Alexa request signatures
* Has decorators to map Alexa requests and intent slots to view functions
* Helps construct ask and tell responses, reprompts and cards
* Makes session management easy
* Allows for the separation of code and speech through Jinja templates
